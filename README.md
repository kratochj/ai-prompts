# AI Prompts Repository

This repository contains my growing collection of AI prompts that I use for various purposes. The goal is to create a comprehensive resource of useful prompts for working with artificial intelligence.

## Project Structure

Currently, the repository contains the following folder:

- `book-crafting/`: Prompts related to book and story creation
  - `plot-twist.md`: Prompt for generating interesting plot twists and turns in a story
  - `proofreader.md`: Prompt for proofreading and editing text
  - `proofreader-2.md`: Advanced prompt for comprehensive creative writing feedback

## Usage

Each file contains a specific prompt or set of instructions for AI. You can use them with compatible AI models to achieve desired results.

### Language Instructions

Many prompts in this repository include instructions to use a specific language (currently Czech). This allows for flexibility in the output language. If you need to use a different language, you can easily modify this part of the prompt to suit your needs.

### Tested AI Models

These prompts have been tested on the following AI models:

- ChatGPT-4
- Claude.ai

While these prompts are designed to work well with these models, they may also be compatible with other AI language models. Feel free to experiment and share your results!

## Expanding the Collection

This collection will be continuously expanded with new prompts and categories as needed.
